 <h2>Reasons to get a website</h2>
 <p>In this age, it is very needful for a business to possess it's own website. A website is a quick 
    and easy way to expand its reach to potential clients and also 
    with a website, any business can keep up with competitors. Nearly every successful company 
    has a website which serves as a portal for updates apart from sales. </p>
    <p> A website also serves as a medium to reduce the cost of other types 
        of advertisement because it provides unlimited 
        ways through which a seller or business can demonstate their product. If the 
        business offers home delivery, it needs to utilize a website
         because the website would be beneficial to consumers as it saves them 
         from the hassle of shoping in person when they can just shop online anytime, anywhere.</p>
